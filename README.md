Code for a simple book review website. I did not want to use GoodReads and I found no suitable apps for my purpose.
Ideally, I will be able to build this into a small cross platform app (the main other person and I who will be using this app use different platforms), but on the web I would like to be able to push reviews without having to log into Neocities. I plan to build functionality where I can write the review and have the site update accordingly, but I don't think I have ready access to technology to do that yet.
